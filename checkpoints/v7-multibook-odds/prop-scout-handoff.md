# Prop Scout — Project Handoff

> **How to use this doc:** Upload `prop-scout-handoff.md` and `prop-scout-v7.jsx` to a new Claude session and say: *"Read the handoff doc and the JSX file. We're continuing development of Prop Scout."* Claude will have full context on every decision made and can pick up immediately.

## What Is Prop Scout?

A personal MLB sports betting research app that compresses pre-game prop research from hours to minutes. Mobile-first React app (max-width 480px) with a dark Discord-style card UI. The entire frontend is a single JSX file — intentional, keeps it portable.

---

## How to Run (New Machine Setup)

### Prerequisites
- Node.js (v18+)
- The project folder: `ai-agent-mlb/`
- A `.env` file in the project root (see Environment Variables below)

### Step 1 — Install frontend dependencies
```bash
cd ai-agent-mlb
npm install
```

### Step 2 — Install backend dependencies
```bash
cd ai-agent-mlb/backend
npm install
```

### Step 3 — Start the backend (Terminal 1)
```bash
cd ai-agent-mlb/backend
npm start
# Runs on http://localhost:3001
```

### Step 4 — Start the frontend (Terminal 2)
```bash
cd ai-agent-mlb
npm run dev
# Runs on http://localhost:5173
```

Open `http://localhost:5173` in a narrow browser window (under 520px wide) or use browser DevTools → Toggle Device Toolbar.

---

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in `ai-agent-mlb/` with:

```
ODDS_API_KEY=your_key_here
VITE_ODDS_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

- `ODDS_API_KEY` — used by the backend (Node/Express via `process.env`)
- `VITE_ODDS_API_KEY` — used by the frontend (Vite via `import.meta.env`)
- Both point to the same key from [the-odds-api.com](https://the-odds-api.com)
- `.env` is gitignored — never commit it

---

## Sandbox Flags (top of prop-scout-v7.jsx)

These three booleans at the top of the file control which data sources are live vs mock:

```js
const IS_SANDBOX       = false; // Open-Meteo weather API
const IS_ODDS_SANDBOX  = false; // The Odds API (sportsbook odds)
const IS_STATS_SANDBOX = false; // MLB Stats API (via backend proxy)
```

| Flag | `true` | `false` |
|---|---|---|
| `IS_SANDBOX` | Mock weather | Live Open-Meteo weather |
| `IS_ODDS_SANDBOX` | Mock odds | Live Odds API (DK/FD/CZR/MGM table) |
| `IS_STATS_SANDBOX` | Mock SLATE games | Live MLB schedule + stats |

The footer auto-describes which sources are live. All three `false` = full live mode.

**Important:** `IS_STATS_SANDBOX = false` requires the backend to be running (`npm start` in `backend/`). If the backend is down, the schedule fetch silently falls back to mock SLATE data.

## Tech Stack

| Layer | Choice | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Frontend | React 18, single JSX file | No component splitting — intentional |
| Styling | Inline styles only | No CSS framework |
| Build tool | Vite 5 | Dev server on :5173, proxies /api → :3001 |
| Weather | Open-Meteo | Free, no key. `IS_SANDBOX = false` to enable |
| Odds | The Odds API | Key in `.env`. `IS_ODDS_SANDBOX = false` to enable |
| MLB Stats | MLB Stats API (statsapi.mlb.com) | Free, no key. CORS-blocked from browser → backend proxy |
| Backend | Node/Express on port 3001 | 4 routes, TTL cache, open CORS |
| Arsenal | Baseball Savant/Statcast | Pending — CSV-based, lowest urgency |
| Database | PostgreSQL | Planned, not started |

---

## API Architecture

### Vite Proxy
Frontend calls `/api/...` (relative URL). Vite dev server proxies to `http://localhost:3001`. `API_BASE = ""` in the JSX — never hardcode the localhost port in the frontend.

### Backend Routes

| Route | Cache TTL | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `GET /api/schedule?date=YYYY-MM-DD` | 1 hour | Hydrates probable pitchers with hand + number via batched `/people` call |
| `GET /api/lineups/:gamePk` | 5 min (confirmed) / 1 min (pending) | Returns `{ confirmed, away[], home[] }` |
| `GET /api/players/:playerId/stats?group=pitching\|hitting` | 6 hours | Shaped to mirror mock data |
| `GET /api/umpires/:gamePk` | 1 hour | Returns `null` gracefully if not yet assigned |

**Known quirk:** MLB Stats API `currentTeam` does NOT include `abbreviation`. Both `schedule.js` and `players.js` use a `TEAM_ABBR[id]` lookup table to resolve it.

### The Odds API
- Endpoint: `/v4/sports/baseball_mlb/odds?regions=us&markets=h2h,totals&oddsFormat=american`
- Target books: DraftKings (`draftkings`), FanDuel (`fanduel`), Caesars (`williamhill_us`), BetMGM (`betmgm`)
- Game matching key: `"AwayTeamFullName|HomeTeamFullName"` — must match exactly between Odds API and live schedule team names
- 15-minute in-memory cache (`oddsCache` module-level object in JSX)
- Books that don't have a line for a game simply don't appear in the table

---

## What's Been Built

### Slate View
- Live game selector from real MLB schedule (or mock SLATE in sandbox mode)
- Each slate card: matchup, time, stadium, O/U, line movement direction, NRFI lean, weather badge, pitcher K prop lean
- Loading spinner while live schedule fetches
- "· LIVE" label on live games

### Game Card — 5 Tabs

#### Overview Tab
- Head-to-head matchup score (0–100, multi-factor formula)
- Pitcher card: jersey number, team, hand, ERA, WHIP, K/9, BB/9, avg IP/K/PC/ER
- Batter card: jersey number, team, hand, AVG, OPS, avg H/HR/TB, hit rate
- Batter hit rate tracker (last 10 games: hits / HR / 2+ TB)

#### Lineup Tab
- Away/home toggle
- 9-batter rows, tap to expand drawer
- Each row: order, name, position, hand, AVG, last 5 hit dots, matchup score badge
- Expanded drawer: season stats, AVG + whiff % per pitch in starter's arsenal, matchup lean
- Lineup vulnerability summary bar (whole lineup vs each pitch)
- Empty state if lineups not yet confirmed

#### Arsenal Tab
- Each pitch: usage bar, batter AVG vs it, whiff rate, HANDLES/WEAK SPOT/NEUTRAL badge
- Exposure alerts: heavy usage + weak spot = red alert; heavy usage + handles = green multiplier
- Empty state if arsenal not yet loaded (Baseball Savant pending)

#### Intel Tab
- **Weather card**: temp, wind direction relative to park (e.g. "7 mph IN from CF"), humidity, rain chance, open air vs dome. LIVE badge when real data. 30-min cache.
- **Umpire card**: home plate ump name from MLB API, K rate, BB rate, tendency, PITCHER/NEUTRAL UMP badge
- **NRFI/YRFI card**: both teams' first-inning scoring % and tendencies
- **Bullpen cards** (away + home): grade (A–C), fatigue level, setup depth, L/R balance, expandable reliever list
- **Odds & Line Movement card**:
  - Live mode: multi-book comparison table (DK / FD / CZR / MGM) showing away ML, home ML, total, over odds, under odds per book. Missing books omitted gracefully.
  - Demo mode: single StatMini layout with mock numbers
  - Line movement text always shown below
  - Refresh button (↺) + API calls remaining + last updated time

#### Props Tab
- Confidence meter per prop (0–100 bar), lean badge, reasoning
- Empty state ("Prop Engine Pending") when no props — all live games until the prop engine is built

## Matchup Scoring Engine

The core intelligence. Calculates 0–100 score for how a batter matches up against a pitcher's arsenal.

```
AVG component   (45%) — scaled .150 floor to .400 ceiling
Whiff component (35%) — 0% whiff = best, 50%+ = worst
SLG component   (20%) — scaled .200 floor to .700 ceiling
```

Modifiers: usage capped at 40% per pitch; same-hand matchup applies 0.92 penalty.

| Score | Color | Label |
|---|---|---|
| < 35 | 🟢 Green | Pitcher Edge |
| 35–54 | 🟡 Yellow | Neutral |
| 55+ | 🔴 Red | Batter Edge |

Game 1 of mock SLATE (NYY@PHI) has fully enriched `vsPitches` data. Other mock games fall back to estimated whiff (20%) and SLG (avg × 1.6).

---

## Data Flow (Live Mode)

```
React App (localhost:5173)
    ↓ /api/* (Vite proxy)
Node/Express (localhost:3001)
    ↓
MLB Stats API (statsapi.mlb.com) — free, no auth
    schedule → probable pitchers → lineups → umpires → player stats

React App (browser)
    ↓ direct fetch (browser-safe)
Open-Meteo — weather by stadium coordinates
The Odds API — DK/FD/CZR/MGM lines
```

The mock SLATE array is always present as a fallback scaffold. Live data overlays specific fields gracefully — the app stays functional even when APIs are unreachable.

---

## Mock-to-Live Overlay Pattern

`buildLiveGame(sg)` converts a live schedule game into a game-card-compatible object, using `SLATE[0]` as a template for fields not yet API-backed (arsenal, props, bullpen, nrfi, batter). As each new data source comes online, it overlays the corresponding field.

`activeSlate`: live schedule or mock SLATE, controlled by `IS_STATS_SANDBOX`.

`getGameOdds(g)`: merges live Odds API data over mock odds using `"AwayTeamFullName|HomeTeamFullName"` key.

---

## Future Enhancements (Logged, Not Started)

- **Prediction market odds (Kalshi / Polymarket)** — The Odds API does not cover prediction markets. OddsPapi (oddspapi.io) aggregates Kalshi + Polymarket + sportsbooks in one normalized response. Could add a prediction market row to the multi-book odds table.
- **Baseball Savant arsenal feed** — Pitcher pitch mix %, velocity, whiff rate by pitch type. CSV export endpoint. Updates per start. This unlocks real arsenal data in the Arsenal tab and real matchup scores in the Lineup tab.
- **Prop engine** — Once arsenal data lands, generate prop confidence scores from pitcher matchup data, park factors, weather, umpire zone.
- **Trends layer** — Prop hit rate on specific lines (e.g. Judge OVER 1.5 TB last 10 games), pitcher K prop home vs away hit rate, NRFI streaks
- **Injury flags** — Manual flag system to mark players questionable/out
- **Park factors** — HR factor, hit factor, K factor per stadium integrated into game card
- **Prop tracker** — Log picks, track hit rate over time
- **Full desktop layout** — Currently shows warning screen over 520px; responsive layout is future enhancement
- **Bullpen dedicated tab** — Currently in Intel tab; full dedicated tab discussed
- **PostgreSQL** — Pre-aggregated splits, arsenal snapshots, historical logs, park factors, umpire history

## Key Design Decisions

| Decision | Choice | Reason |
|---|---|---|
| Single JSX file | Intentional | Portable, easy to hand off, no build complexity |
| Desktop handling | Warning screen >520px | Prompts user to resize; full layout is future work |
| Scoring formula | 3-factor (AVG + whiff + SLG) | AVG-only caused score compression (all batters 22–27) |
| Mock scaffold | Always present | App stays functional when APIs down/slow |
| Overlay pattern | Field-by-field | Graceful — never breaks if one API fails |
| Vite proxy | `/api` → `:3001` | No CORS issues, no hardcoded ports in frontend |
| Book matching | Exact full-name key | Odds API uses full team names; must match schedule names |
